# Hi there

I'm Joas Onvlee, welcome to my GitHub page. I am currently studying embedded software engineering at Avans University of Applied Sciences. This page is mainly used to host school and side projects. Some repositories will be outdated, but I try my best to keep everything updated. Feel free to look around.
