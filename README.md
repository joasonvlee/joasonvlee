# Hi there

I'm Joas Onvlee, welcome to my GitHub page. I am currently studying Computer Science at Avans University of Applied Sciences. This page is mainly used to host school and side project repositories. Most of these repositories here are primarily intended as portfolio material. Some repositories will be outdated, but I try my best to keep everything updated. Feel free to look around.
